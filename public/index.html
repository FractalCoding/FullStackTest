		<h1>Scalable, Dockerized, Node based P5.JS Apps!</h1>
		<h2> I'm speedrunning learning my stack and ops in 10 days, let's see where we can go.</h2>
		<p>This sketch comes prepackaged with this Docker image as a test script, but by adding
	   	your own HTML file on your own port and starting your dockerfile to listen on that port (default 5555),
	   	you will be able to launch your own P5.js scripts in a node docker container!
		</p>
		<p>
		All you need to do is provide the following HTML file:
		(As Script srcs)
		
		</br><h3>
		https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/1.3.1/p5.js
		</br>
 		sketch.js
		</br></h3>

		somewhere in the HTML file.

		You want your HTML File and your sketch.js file to be in a folder named public under root. 

		Then in root you want this as a file called server.js which you list as your main file in your package.json.
		You don't need to install dependencies--they're already here for you! 
		</br>
		Somewhere in index.html, your sketch.js... both in /app. 
		</br>
		Your server.js is in root and looks like this:
		</p>
		</br>
		<h3>
		const express = require('express');</br>
		const app = express();</br>
		const port = 5555;</br>
		</br>
		app.use(express.static('public'));</br>
		</br>
		app.get('/', function(req, res) {</br>
  			res.sendFile(__dirname + '/sketch.js');</br>
		});</br>
		</br>
		app.listen(port, function() {</br>
 		console.log(`Server running on port ${port}. If webpage does not appear, try restarting the docker container
		 using the following command: \ndocker run -p 8080:${po>
		</br>;});
		</br>
		</br></h3>
		<p>
		Be sure to include both in packages.json. You do not need to include express or p5 because these are already packaged in this container. 
		</br>
		Great! Now you have a way to deploy containerized node p5.js applications!
